# Interpreter for Lox language

## Instructions

1. Compile the program
```bash
$ rustc src/main.rs -o lox
```

*NOTE:* To compile in debug mode, use the following command:

```bash
$ rustc src/main -o lox --cfg debug_lox
```

[Conditional Compilation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html)

2. Execute as REPL
```bash
$ ./lox
>
```

or give a lox script as input
```bash
$ ./lox [FILE_NAME]
```

## Syntax Grammar

### Version 2 (Operator Precedence)

```text
expression -> equality ;
equality -> comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison -> term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
term -> factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
factor -> unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
unary -> ( "!" | "-" ) unary
               | primary ;
primary -> NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil"
               | "(" expression ")" ;
```

### Version 1

The bellow grammar would be used to create a syntax tree which is abstract
 (AST).

```text
expression -> literal
            | grouping
            | unary
            | binary;

literal -> NUMBER
         | STRING
         | "true"
         | "false"
         | "nil";

grouping -> "(" expression ")";

binary -> expression operator expression;

operator -> "*"
          | "/"
          | "-"
          | "+"
          | "=="
          | "!="
          | "<"
          | ">"
          | "<="
          | ">=";
```
